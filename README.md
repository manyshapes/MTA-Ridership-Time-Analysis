# MTAPD Ridership Time Analysis
Finding Off Peak Hours to Maximize Public Health Interests for the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority
This project was performed as piece of a course taught by [@metis](https://github.com/thisismetis), San Francisco branch.  

## Objective
2-3 sentences

### Dataset
MTA's turnstile data is publicly available information, updated every Saturday. The data source can be found [here.](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) Each turnstile, cataloguing entrances and exits of MTA passengers, updates its records every four hours. Passage numbers are a cummulative running total. These turnstiles are then reset periodically for system maintenance. These resets can be viewed as a unique quirk of this dataset.

### Tools Used
**Jupyter Notebooks** was used as an interface through which **Python** was employed.
**Pandas** was used for data access & transformation. **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** were both used for plotting. **Numpy** is used for math that handles quirky outliers.


## Start Here 
FootTraffic Calculations Final.ipynb has all code needed to perform the exploratory data analysis. This file includes, in following order, data retrieval (online & locally), data processing, relevant findings & plotting. Original data used for this data analysis is available within the .csv files. 

### Findings
